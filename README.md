# Hospital Management System
A simple Java console application to manage patients, doctors, and assignments in a hospital setting.

## Project Overview
This application provides a straightforward system to manage hospital operations including:
- **Patient Management**: Add, view, and search for patients
- **Doctor Management**: Add and view doctors with their specializations
- **Assignment Management**: Assign patients to doctors and track relationships
- **Diagnosis Tracking**: Update and manage patient diagnoses
- **Detailed Records**: View comprehensive information about doctors and their assigned patients

## Features

### Core Functionality
1. **Add Patient** - Register new patients with name and age
2. **Add Doctor** - Register new doctors with name and specialization
3. **View Patients** - Display all registered patients with their details (ID, name, age, diagnosis, assigned doctor)
4. **View Doctors** - List all registered doctors with patient counts
5. **Assign Patient to Doctor** - Link a patient to a doctor for treatment
6. **Update Patient Diagnosis** - Record and update medical diagnosis for patients
7. **Search Patient** - Find patients by name (partial match supported)
8. **View Doctor Details** - Display a specific doctor and their complete list of assigned patients

### Data Validation
- Prevents null or empty patient/doctor names
- Validates age as non-negative
- Prevents duplicate patient assignments to the same doctor
- Safe numeric input parsing with error handling

### User Experience
- Interactive menu system with clear options
- Input validation with helpful error messages
- Emoji indicators for better visual feedback (✅ ❌ 👋)
- Empty state messaging when no records exist
- Try-with-resources for safe resource management

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Navigate to project: `cd JavaApp`
3. Compile: `javac -d bin src/com/example/*.java`
4. Run: `java -cp bin com.example.HospitalManagementSystem`
5. Follow on-screen menu

## Troubleshooting

- **"javac: command not found"**: Install JDK from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/
- **Compilation errors**: Ensure all .java files are in src/com/example/
